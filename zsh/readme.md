# ZSH Setup

I am running [Spaceship](https://spaceship-prompt.sh/) for my prompt which is
being installed via brew. The config file can be placed in the `~/.config`
folder.

The `.zshrc` replaces the `~/.zshrc`. Make sure that the all path adjustments
always add on to the end of the path and not the beginning.
